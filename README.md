LyricView
=========
Android LyricView that accepts lrc stream as input.

This is actually a sub-part of my another project [LyricHere](https://github.com/markzhai/LyricHere).

As that one is too large, I pick core part of lyric play feature and name it LyricView.

This library offers a simple view that accepts lrc stream as input, and it will automatically move according the timestamp of each sentence in lyric. It also supports scroll gesture.
